//! Careful abstraction of geometric shapes in a ray tracer is a key
//! component of a clean system design, and shapes are the ideal
//! candidate for an object-oriented approach. All geometric
//! primitives implement a common interface, and the rest of the
//! renderer can use this interface without needing any details about
//! the underlying shape. This makes it possible to separate the
//! geometric and the shading subsystem of pbrt.
